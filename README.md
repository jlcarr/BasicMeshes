# BasicMeshes
A collection of basic 3D meshes.

## Description
This repository is to hold a collection of simple mesh files for geometries I might need in the future.
It was originally created for me to save meshes I made with the purpose of importing to Godot for my IsoMAZEtric game.

### Creation Process
The process I went through was:
1. Design the geometry in OpenSCAD
2. Export the geometry as an .stl file
3. Import the .stl file into FreeCAD
4. Export the geometry from FreeCAD to .obj

### Meshes Available
- Ramp
- Staircase
- Thin Staircase

### File Formats Available
- STL
- Wavefront .obj
- OpenSCAD
